The packages FEMfine.m and handlebodies.m together compute the boundary metric for handlebody solutions of Einstein equations in the conformal frame where the Ricci curvature of the boundary is a constant -2 in AdS units. The usage is detailed in documentation.pdf, which has been previously published as https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.02711.
